<!-- USAGE -->
## Usage
Many of these packages were used to construct data analysis and EDA on these data sets. 
For example we were able to establish a relationship between Alcohol By Volume and International Bitterness Units as well as estalbish a linear regression model with provided statistics and its established relationship.
